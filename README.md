# Formulate
![Formulate logo](res/data/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/com.github.eemilp.Formulate.svg)

A calculator for solving problems.

## !Experimental notice!
Formulate is still experimental and under development. This means that crashes and bugs will likely occurr and there is no guarantees on file backwards compatability! You can lose your work!

## What?
Formulate combines the fantastic formula editor from [Plots](https://github.com/alexhuntley/Plots) to the powerful calculator [Calculate](https://qalculate.github.io/) in a notebook style interface. 

### Goals
 - Unify the process of thinking, typesetting and calculating as much as possible. Math should look like math when being worked on. 
 - Encourage documenting why a calculation in the process of solving a problem was done
 - Enable sharing of calculations in some standard format like pdf with pretty enough typesetting

### Non-goals
 - Heavy/complex calculations; These are already served by tools such as Maxima or Juypyter notebooks
 - Typesetting of documents; LaTeX and TeXMacs already do this well

## Building
Formulate can be built using Flatpak and Gnome Builder.
